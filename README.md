# Cammy

A simple camera editor to change various game defaults such as zoom and fov.
For use with [FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goaaats/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

## Installation
For installation instructions, please see my [custom plugin repository](https://github.com/UnknownX7/DalamudPluginRepo).

## Disclaimer
This is a zoomhack, if you aren't comfortable with that fact, don't install it. I'm not responsible if you stream with it and people notice and every "community" decides to exile you. Also, if Square Enix decides to start banning people for using 3rd party tools before the game shuts down.
